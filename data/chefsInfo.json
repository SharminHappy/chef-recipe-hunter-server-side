You can also add a little bit of Korean chili flakes to give it a slight kick.Note that this recipe is similar to the Korean BBQ restaurant-style doenjang stew recipe found in my cookbook; Korean Cooking Favorites.

People typically use a high-quality anchovy stock. However, I like to take things up a notch by using rice water instead of plain water as the base.The water left over after rinsing rice is simply rice water. It contains starch that can thicken the stew and add depth to its flavor. If you prefer a thinner stew, you can use plain water instead.To make the stock, all you need to do is simmer dried anchovies and a piece of dried sea kelp in the rice starch water for 3-4 minutes. Then, simply discard the anchovies and sea kelp, and your stock is ready to use!",
